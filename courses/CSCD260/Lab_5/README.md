# Instructions
## Part 1
Using two registers, R0 and R1, and **conditional instruction(s) only**, write an assembly code to implement the function 洧녭 defined as follows:  

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0; & x < 0 \\
1; & x \ge 0
\end{cases}
$$

You can move some 洧논 to R0. The output of the function should be in R1.

## Part 2
Using two registers, R0 and R1, and **conditional instruction(s) only**, write an assembly code to implement the function 洧녭 defined as follows (notice the difference between this problem and the previous one):
  
$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0; & x \le 0 \\
1; & x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
  
You can move some 洧논 to R0. The output of the function should be in R1.
## Part 3
Using two registers, R0 and R1, and **conditional instruction(s) only**, write an assembly code to implement the function 洧녭 defined as follows (this function is known as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) in a neural network context):
  
$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0; & x < 0 \\
x; & x \ge 0
\end{cases}
$$

You can move some 洧논 to R0. The output of the function should be in R1.
## Part 4
Using two registers, R0 and R1, and **conditional instruction(s) only**, write an assembly code to implement the function 洧녭 defined as follows:

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0; & x < 0 \\
x; & x \ge 0
\end{cases}
$$
    
You can move some 洧논 to R0. The output of the function should be in R1.
## Part 5
Using two registers, R0 and R1, and **branch instruction(s) only**, write an assembly code to implement the function 洧녭 defined as follows (the value of 洧논 can be interpreted as the day of the week (1 representing Monday) and the function outputs 1/0 can be interpreted as indicating whether it is a weekday or a weekend; note that the function definition is equivalent to a switch statement):

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
1; & x = 1\\
1; & x = 2\\
1; & x = 3\\
1; & x = 4\\
1; & x = 5\\
0; & x = 6\\
0; & x = 7\\
\end{cases}
$$
