# Instructions
## Part 1

Write an assembly payroll program which will compute the total monthly pay of anemployee. 
The formula for total pay is as follows:
- Total monthly pay in $ = base pay in $ + number of overtime hours × (2.5 × hourly rate in $)
- In your code, you can assume that the monthly base pay is $5000, number of overtime hours in a month is 15, and hourly rate is $32.50.
- You can only use integer arithmetic.  
**Hint:** There is no requirement that your code computes the monthly pay in $.

## Part 2

Write an assembly program which will compute the factorial of 5. Do not use a loop.  
**Note:** You can use at most two registers, R0 and R1, and your final answer should be in R0.  

## Part 3

Write an assembly program which will compute 𝑎3 − 3𝑎2𝑏 + 3𝑎𝑏2 − 𝑏3.  
Feel free to use any value of 𝑎 and 𝑏 (to be moved into registers R0 and R1), but I will ask you to use specific values when you demo (you will only be allowed to edit the two numbers you initially move to R0 and R1 when you demo).  
**Note:** Your final answer should be in R0. If you can write a code which uses at most two registers, you will receive a 5-point bonus.
