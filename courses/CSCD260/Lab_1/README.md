# Instructions
- Write an assembly program which will add up the four integers, 50, 100, 150, and 200.
- Your code must not use more than two registers (use R0 and R1) and the final result must be available in R0.
- You will need to use the ADD and MOV instructions, but also experiment with ADDS (which updates the CPSR flags).
